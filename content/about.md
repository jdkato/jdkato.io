My name is Joseph Kato.

Iâ€™m a [software developer](https://github.com/jdkato) from Portland, Oregon.

In my free time, I enjoy running and hiking. You can find some of my past
results at [Athletic.net][1], [Athlinks][2], and [Strava][3].

### Interests

- *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*: I wrote and maintain [an NLP library][4]
  for the Go programming language. It's used by a number of open-source
  projects, including [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (which powers this blog).

- *Applied Mathematics* (primarily Linear Algebra): I have a B.S. in
  mathematics from [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/math/),
  where I earned membership in the National Mathematics Honor Society
  ([Pi Mu Epsilon](https://pme-math.org/what-is-pme)).

- *Collaborative Writing*: I wrote a [syntax-aware linter][5] designed to
  improve writing quality by enforcing [externally-defined][6] rules. It's
  currently used by [Linode](https://github.com/linode/docs/issues),
  [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs), and
  [GOV.UK](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-developer-docs) (among others).

### Skills

#### Languages

- Proficient: Go & Python (5,000+ lines written)
- Comfortable: JavaScript, Swift, Java & Rust  (500 - 1,000 lines written)
- Past experience: C, C++, R, & Julia

#### Other

  site generators, CI/CD, markup, etc.)
