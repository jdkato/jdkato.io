# jdkato.io [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdkato/jdkato.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdkato/jdkato.io)

This repository serves two purposes: it houses my personal website (built with [Markdown](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/welcome-to-commonmark-discussion/8), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)) and acts as playground for experimenting with state-of-the-art automated testing techniques.

The Continuous Integration ([CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)) pipeline currently includes tests for **markup**, **spelling**, **style**, **links**, and **accessibility**.
