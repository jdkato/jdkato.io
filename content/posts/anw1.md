I have not missed an episode of [American Ninja Warrior][1] (ANW) since its
fourth season in 2012. And while ANW is certainly more of a reality TV show
than a traditional sport, it feels like too little emphasis is placed on its
few sport-like qualities. This is perhaps most evident in the practically
nonexistent use of data and statistics&mdash;two cornerstones of most sports.
Questions like "What's Elet Hall's average time on the Quintuple Steps?" or
"How long does Joe Moravsky usually rest between obstacles?" go largely
unanswered.

In an attempt to answer some of these questions, I've collected data on every
televised run during season 7. In a series of posts, I intend to discuss the
process, my findings, a few opportunities for visualizations, and a new
statistic&mdash;similar to the NBA's [Player Efficiency Rating][2]&mdash;that
will aid in the creation of ANW power rankings.

### Data Collection

Obviously, there are a number of challenges involved in trying to take accurate
splits from a TV broadcast&mdash;a few of which are outlined below.

1. **Misrepresentation of elapsed time**: You'll notice that in many runs there
   are "jumps" in time. For example, after showing a competitor's family for
   three seconds, the clock will have jumped 40 seconds.
2. **Camera panning**: The key points for split-taking are when a competitor
   starts and completes an obstacle. Unfortunately, these moments are not
   always available to the viewer.
3. **Not every competitor is shown**: A competitor's run can be completely
   shown, partially shown, or not shown at all.

The workaround for (1) is to only use the official clock (rather than a
stopwatch, for instance). This ensures that the split estimates sum to the
official run time. Consider, for example, Kevin Bull's Qualifying run from
season 7:

| Transition | Elapsed Time (sec) |     Obstacle     | Elapsed Time (sec) |
|:----------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|
|      0     |          0         |  Quintuple Steps |        2.73        |
|      1     |        7.09        | Mini Silk Slider |        2.41        |
|      2     |        1.07        |   Tilting Table  |        1.29        |
|      3     |        1.14        |    Spin Cycle    |        8.93        |
|      4     |        3.50        |  Hourglass Drop  |        18.91       |
|      5     |        5.56        |    Warped Wall   |        3.77        |

We see that the sum of Kevin's individual splits (56.4 seconds) matches his
[official clocking][3]. And while this may seem rather time-consuming at first
glance, it doesn't require much more effort than simply watching does. This is
especially true since I've written two simple Python scripts to do most of the
heavy lifting: [split_taking.py][4] (for courses with no time limit) and
[split_taking_mt.py][5] (for courses with a time limit&mdash;e.g., 2:30.00).

(2) and (3), on the other hand, are simply limitations of the method: we're
going to have incomplete data due to some runs not being shown and we're going
to have some inaccuracy introduced by inconvenient camera positions. That said,
I still think this project provides an interesting look at the role that data
and statistics could play in ANW.

### The Database

<img src="/img/database.png" alt="Database Structure" class="img-thumbnail">

As I watched each episode, I created CSV files consisting of rows like the following:

```text
Kevin Bull,30,M,2.73,7.09,2.41,1.07,1.29,1.14,8.93,3.50,18.91,5.56,3.77,56.4,Completed
```

These CSV files are then converted into a SQLite database (the structure of
which is shown above), making the answers to many interesting questions a mere
query away. For example, the fastest times on the Quintuple Steps from Venice
Qualifying:

<!-- vale core.Spelling = NO -->

I'm sure this list isn't particularly surprising to anyone who follows ANW but,
as you can probably imagine, a database like this can answer *many* more
questions (some of which will be discussed in subsequent posts).

### Run Flow

The first visualization we're going to discuss is called the "Run Flow." It
attempts to provide a means for both analyzing an individual run and comparing
two different runs. Check it out below!

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

<form class="bs-example bs-example-form" data-example-id="input-group-with-button">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="form-group col-sm-6">
            <label for="comp1" class="h4">Ninja 1</label>
            <input type="text" class="form-control" id="comp1" placeholder="Kevin Bull" data-provide="typeahead" autocomplete="off">
        </div>
        <div class="form-group col-sm-6">
            <label for="comp2" class="h4">Ninja 2</label>
            <input type="text" class="form-control" id="comp2" placeholder="Alan Connealy" data-provide="typeahead" autocomplete="off">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="container" style="min-width: 310px;min-height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>
</form>

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

As you can see, the default parameters compare the two fastest runners of the
night: Kevin Bull and Alan Connealy. It was a fairly tight race until the third
transition, at which point Bull pulled away for good. Another interesting
comparison is between Alan Connealy and Nicholas Coolridge, who collectively
had the closest finishing times of the night.

### Up Next

[In the next post][6] in this series, I plan to take a closer look at the
Qualifying and City Finals episodes: Which course and obstacle were the most
difficult? Who had the most impressive run?

I've also considered making this data freely available through a website
consisting of information such as a leaderboard (overall, men, and women) of
the top-15 competitors and an individualized profile page for each competitor
containing career, course and obstacle statistics. I'll discuss this idea more
thoroughly in future posts but, in the meantime, you can stop by the project's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ninjaref).

As always, feel free to [contact me](/) with any comments or suggestions.
